### Code Refactoring Requirements Document

#### **Project Title:** Code Refactoring for Improved Maintainability and Performance

---

### **1. Present State**

#### **Description:**
- The current codebase has evolved over time without consistent standards.
- Multiple scripts handle different components, including:
  - Configurations
  - Data loading
  - Utility libraries
  - Data transformation functions
- Limited or outdated documentation.
- Code often lacks modularity, with tightly coupled functions and redundant code blocks.
- Existing testing infrastructure is either incomplete or inconsistent.

#### **Strengths:**
- The code performs well under current loads and fulfills core functional requirements.
- It is actively used and understood by a few key team members.

#### **Flaws:**
1. **Readability Issues:**
   - Poor or inconsistent naming conventions.
   - Lack of inline comments and documentation.
2. **Scalability Constraints:**
   - Tightly coupled components hinder scalability and reusability.
3. **Redundant Code:**
   - Repeated logic across multiple modules/scripts.
4. **Performance Bottlenecks:**
   - Inefficient loops and data handling patterns.
5. **Testing and Debugging Challenges:**
   - Minimal test coverage.
   - Debugging is time-consuming due to the code's complexity.
6. **Dependency Management:**
   - Libraries and dependencies are inconsistently updated or documented.

### **2. Future State**

#### **Goals:**
- **Modularity:** Break the code into reusable, self-contained components/functions.
- **Scalability:** Ensure the code can handle increased data loads or feature expansions.
- **Readability:** Improve naming conventions, documentation, and comments.
- **Performance:** Optimize critical code paths for speed and efficiency.
- **Testing:** Achieve at least 80% test coverage with unit and integration tests.
- **Maintainability:** Create clear guidelines for future additions or modifications.
- **Dependency Management:** Consolidate and document dependencies, with clear versioning.

#### **Desired Features:**
- Centralized configuration management.
- Modular and reusable utility functions.
- A well-structured testing framework.
- Documentation for developers and end-users.

### **3. Milestones and Tasks**

#### **Milestone 1: Analysis and Planning**
- **Tasks:**
  1. Conduct a code review to identify redundant and inefficient code blocks.
  2. Document current dependencies and assess their relevance.
  3. Engage stakeholders to identify must-have features and pain points.
  4. Create a high-level architecture plan for the refactored codebase.

#### **Milestone 2: Modularization**
- **Tasks:**
  1. Identify components and scripts that can be modularized.
  2. Refactor reusable functions into a dedicated utility library.
  3. Centralize configurations into a single, environment-aware file.

#### **Milestone 3: Optimization**
- **Tasks:**
  1. Analyze and optimize inefficient code blocks.
  2. Implement data handling best practices (e.g., vectorization, batch processing).
  3. Remove or consolidate redundant code.

#### **Milestone 4: Testing Infrastructure**
- **Tasks:**
  1. Set up a testing framework (e.g., Pytest, unittest).
  2. Write unit tests for individual components.
  3. Implement integration tests for end-to-end scenarios.
  4. Establish a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

#### **Milestone 5: Documentation and Training**
- **Tasks:**
  1. Update or create comprehensive documentation.
  2. Include a developer guide on how to use and extend the refactored codebase.
  3. Provide training sessions or handover notes for the team.

#### **Milestone 6: Deployment and Validation**
- **Tasks:**
  1. Deploy the refactored code to a staging environment.
  2. Validate functionality and performance against the original code.
  3. Collect feedback from users and address any issues.

### **4. Success Metrics**
- Code coverage: ≥80%.
- Average execution time reduced by at least 20%.
- Time required for debugging reduced by at least 50%.
- Team satisfaction: Survey-based improvement in ease of use and maintainability.
- Clear documentation rated positively by at least 90% of developers.
